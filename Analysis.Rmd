Analyze larval density over time between treatments with a linear mixed model

```{r}
z$Day<-as.factor(as.character(z$Day))
model1<-lmer(prop_change~Treatment + Day  + Treatment:Day + (1|Treatment:Conical), data=z) 
summary(model1)
anova(model1, type="II")
hist(residuals(model1)) #passes

posthoc1<-emmeans(model1, ~Treatment|Day, adjust="Tukey")

```


Overall, there are significant effects of treatment and day and interaction of treatment by day. 
1. There is a significant reduction in survivorship over time (sign. effect of day). 
2. There is a signiicant interaction between day and treatment, specifically that there is a significant reduction in survival in cool temperature over time as compared to ambient over time and there is a reduction in high compared to ambient.

Analyze "total" settlement over time between treatments with a linear mixed model. As all chambers started with 100 larvae, we are not using the vector of success and failure. Because this is count data we will use a poisson distribution. Nest chamber within tank as this is repeated measures.  

```{r}
hist(total_settle$total)
total_settle$Day<-as.factor(as.character(total_settle$Day))
model2<-glmer(total ~ Treatment + Day  + Treatment:Day + (1|Tank/Chamber), data=total_settle, family=poisson) 
summary(model2) 
Anova(model2, type=2)
qqPlot(residuals(model2)) 
hist(residuals(model2)) 
posthoc2<-emmeans(model2, ~Treatment|Day, adjust="Tukey")
cld(posthoc2)
pairs(posthoc2)
```

Overall, there is a significant effect of day and treatment on settlement. 
1. There is lower settlement in cool temp compared to ambient and higher settlement in high as compared to ambient (sign. effect of treatment) - basically settlement increases with temp
2. There is significantly higher settlement over time (sign. effect of day)
3. There is an increase in settlement over time in cool temperature, but less settlement over time in high temperature - there are different rates of settlement between treatments (sign. effect of day * treatment interaction)

# Recruit survival

#calculate proportion survival 
recruits$proportion<-(recruits$Success/(recruits$Success+recruits$Failure))*100

#add in larval temperature treatment information - plug 98 did not have larval treatment information and was removed
recruits$Larval.Treatment<-settle$Treatment[match(recruits$Plug.ID, settle$Plug)]

```

Overall, there are significant effects of juvenile treatment and day, but no effect of larval treatment. 

1. There is lower survivorship in high temperature for recruits (sign. effect of juv.treatment)
2. There is a significant reduction in survivorship over time (sign. effect of day). 
3. There is a signiicant interaction between day and treatment, specifically that there is a significant reduction in survival in high temperature over time as compared to ambient over time. There are different rates of survival depending on treatment.
